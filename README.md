PDF-Based Question Answering System using LangChain, Azure OpenAI, FastAPI & React

1. Project Overview
This system enables users to upload a PDF file, ask questions based on its content, and receive contextually accurate responses. It utilizes LangChain and Azure OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) in conjunction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to understand and respond to user queries. The backend is developed using FastAPI, and the frontend interface is built using React.

2. Key Components
2.1 Frontend (React)
Allows users to:


Upload a PDF file.


Enter and submit a question.


View the AI-generated answer in real time.


Interacts with the FastAPI backend through HTTP requests (typically POST).


2.2 Backend (FastAPI)
Receives the uploaded PDF and stores or processes it temporarily.


Extracts text from the PDF file and segments it into manageable chunks.


Converts the text chunks into vector representations for efficient retrieval.


Stores the vectors using an in-memory or on-disk vector database like FAISS.


Receives user questions and uses vector similarity search to find relevant context.


Passes the context along with the question to an Azure-hosted LLM using LangChainâ€™s RAG chain.


Returns the generated answer to the frontend.



3. System Workflow
PDF Upload
 The user uploads a PDF through the frontend interface. The file is sent to the FastAPI backend for processing.


Text Extraction & Chunking
 The backend reads the PDF, extracts its text, and splits the content into smaller, overlapping chunks to preserve semantic meaning.


Vector Embedding Generation
 Each chunk is transformed into a high-dimensional vector using an embedding model. These vectors represent the semantic content of the chunks.


Vector Indexing
 The vector representations are stored in a vector database (such as FAISS), allowing for fast retrieval of similar text segments based on a query.


User Question Handling
 When a user submits a question, the backend searches the vector database to retrieve the most relevant chunks of text.


Contextual Answer Generation
 The retrieved context is combined with the userâ€™s question and passed to the Azure OpenAI model via LangChainâ€™s Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The LLM generates a response based on the input.


Answer Delivery
 The generated answer is returned to the frontend and displayed to the user.



4. Technologies Used
LangChain: Framework for building LLM-powered applications with chaining and memory support.


Azure OpenAI: Provides access to large language models deployed securely and scalably.


FAISS: An efficient vector similarity search library used for storing and querying text embeddings.


FastAPI: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.


React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.



5. Features
Interactive Q&A Interface
 Users can interact with documents conversationally, similar to a chatbot.


Context-Aware Responses
 Thanks to the RAG architecture, the system ensures that answers are relevant to the content of the uploaded PDF.


Scalable and Modular
 Components are designed to be modular, making it easy to upgrade the vector database, embedding model, or frontend independently.



6. Use Cases
Reading and understanding complex documents.


Educational and academic document support.


Legal or policy document summarization and Q&A.


Technical support documentation assistants.



7. Future Improvements
Support for multiple document uploads.


Persistent storage and retrieval of document sessions.


Integration of multi-modal capabilities (e.g., images and tables).


User authentication and document access control.
